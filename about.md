### Luciano Nieto
Lisbon, Portugal

- My career path kicked off when I was just 16 years old. That's when I enroled a programming logic course at SENAC in SÃ£o Paulo. Right then, I knew I was heading in the right direction. When I started the college I'd my first introduction to working with data, and it was there that I discovered my passion for Business Intelligence. 

- I put in 8 years of work in this realm until the Big Data wave hit. Since 2019, I've been fully immersed in Big Data solutions, with a strong focus on the cloud.

- In late 2020, I took a bigger leap and shifted to Europe - to Portugal. This change opened doors for me to dive into global projects and experience diverse cultures, all while being with my wife. I'm really into tech stuff, especially data, and I'm also a big fan of Aviation.

- In this blog, I share my personal projects that help me keep up to date with the latest technologies and work in different areas. I also love testing out some conceptual ideas and seeing where they take me. 

- I hope you're enjoying.
