This pipeline provides a comprehensive demonstration of the end-to-end process, excluding the initial data source integration. It encompasses best practices in data modeling (star schema), leverages the power of Spark for distributed computation, and ultimately delivers a compelling outcome in the form of a detailed Power BI report. 

The end-to-end process reveals Amazon website sales data for the year 2022, sourced from Kaggle, widely regarded as the top repository in the realm of Data Science. This dataset focuses on a specific region in India, offering a captivating opportunity to break it down into segments and showcase the power of data processing and transformation using Python / SPARK. The experience is so intuitive.

To enhance the dataset's quality, I integrated an Indian postal code API, addressing the issue of numerous empty or inaccurate data points within the dataset - its related in the following code transformation.
