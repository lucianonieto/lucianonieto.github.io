In this research, I conducted an in-depth analysis of NVIDIA's stock trends up until June 2024. To achieve this, I utilized the Gemini API along with artificial intelligence to observe and interpret the stock trend charts over time.

## Methodology:
- Tools Used: For the static analysis, I employed Python, which enabled me to generate detailed visualizations of the stock price fluctuations.
- AI Integration: With the help of the Gemini API, I integrated financial data with AI to forecast trends and gain a deeper understanding of NVIDIA's stock behavior.
