In the era of artificial intelligence, I invested in an in-depth examination of NVIDIA's stock trends up until June 2024. By leveraging the Gemini API and advanced AI techniques, it was possible to observe and interpret stock trend charts over time with enhanced precision and insight.

## Methodology:
- Tools Used: For the static analysis, I employed Python with Matplotlib, which enabled me to generate detailed visualizations of the stock price fluctuations.
- AI Integration: With the help of the Gemini API, I integrated financial data with AI to forecast trends and gain a deeper understanding of NVIDIA's stock behavior.
