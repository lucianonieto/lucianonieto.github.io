As a data professional, understand web applications can be quite challenging due to its distinct development landscape. Despite this, I had a idea of creating a straightforward solution that demystifies the entire process and offers a clearly idea how the things works under the hood. 

Along this, I decided to develop a simple implementation that provides a hands-on understanding of the complete process, from the backend operations to the inner workings behind serving data to web clients.

## Technical solution

## Requirements

To use these scripts, you will need the following:

- API Open Weather Key: https://openweathermap.org/ (free tier)
- Python 3.x
- flask package: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- pandas package: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
- psycopg2 package: Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
- json package: The JSON module in Python allows you to encode and decode custom objects by using JSON encoder and decoder classes.

## Docker file

This is our environment setup - managed by Docker compose file:

## Configuration file

After generate your API Key, input on the configuration file and also the another assets, such as the configuration for the PostgreSQL.

## Get Data from OpenWeatherMap

This script will insert the data to the dataset.

## Publish the Flask App

- To make the web app available, just run the following script.

## Outcome

- While the App is running, the endpoint is related to your route and it's already available for consumption.
