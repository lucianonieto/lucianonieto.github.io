## Intro

As a data professional, understand web applications can be quite challenging due to its distinct development landscape. Despite this, I had a idea of creating a straightforward solution that demystifies the entire process and offers a clearly idea how the things works under the hood. 

Along this, I decided to develop a simple implementation that provides a hands-on understanding of the complete process, from the backend operations to the inner workings behind serving data to web clients.

## Requirements

To use these scripts, you will need the following:

- API Open Weather Key: https://openweathermap.org/ (free tier)
- Python 3.x
- flask package: Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- pandas package: pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
- psycopg2 package: Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
- json package: The JSON module in Python allows you to encode and decode custom objects by using JSON encoder and decoder classes.

## Docker

This is our environment setup - managed by Docker compose file:
